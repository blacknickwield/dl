# ViT
## 2024.3.31
Paper reproduction for "AN IMAGE IS WORTH 16X16 WORDS: TRANSFORMERS FOR IMAGE RECOGNITION AT SCALE", which if also known as ViT.
Reproduction on mnist has also been finished. The accuracy can reach up to 98.02%.
Here are the plans for the next steps:
1. Replace `torch.nn.TransformerEncoder` and `torch.nn.TransformerEncoderLayer` with manual implementation.
2. Reproduce ViT on other datasets, cifar10 for example.
